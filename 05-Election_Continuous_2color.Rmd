# Election Map: Continuous with 2 Colors

Instead of bins you can use a continuous scale. The map below uses a continuous scale with 2 colors. The two colors, red and blue, become become purple in the middle where they mix.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
pal <- colorNumeric(
  palette = colorRampPalette(c('red', 'blue'))(length(countyGIS$pctGOP)), 
  domain = countyGIS$pctGOP, reverse=TRUE)

leaflet(countyGIS, options = leafletOptions(crsClass = "L.CRS.EPSG3857"), width="100%") %>%
  addPolygons(weight = 0.5, color = "gray", opacity = 0.7,
    fillColor = ~pal(pctGOP), fillOpacity = 1, smoothFactor = 0.5,
    label = popupLabels,
    labelOptions = labelOptions(direction = "auto")) %>%
    addPolygons(data = stateGIS,fill = FALSE,color="black",weight = 1) %>%
    addLegend(pal = pal,values = ~countyGIS$pctGOP, opacity = 0.7, title = "% Trump",position = "bottomright")

```
